Q: I was living in Canada with my Canadian wife for the last 6 years and we're seriously considering moving to Spain. I'm Spanish born citizen (also hold a Canadian passport), and my wife is Canadian.

We're looking for the best way to regularize her immigration situation for her. And as I read, she can go to Spain as a tourist (no visa needed for Canadians), and there we can apply for a 'Family member residence card'. But as I was searching the net for information I got some concerns:

One of the requirements for me is been a resident. As I understand, that implies living in Spain for 180 days. Does that mean that I couldn't support my wife application, as it need to be done in the first 90 days after her arrival?

Also, it seems that some town (it's unclear if it's just some of them), stopped to process 'Family member residence cards' and only accept 'Arraigo familiar' applications. I wonder the implications of that. In formation is less clear in this regard.

I wonder if someone have some insight in this matter. Thanks

A: As a citizen, there is no requirement for you to live in Spain for 180 days. 

And you both can always travel as tourists and do all the paperwork in Spain. You need to be empadronado somewhere in Spain to be considered a resident. 

Family member residence cards are for any EU citizen bringing a non EU spouse over, the arraigo familiar is for Spanish citizens bringing their spouse over.
