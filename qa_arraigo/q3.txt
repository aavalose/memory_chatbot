Q: How long can I leave Spain without proof during the three years required for Arraigo Social?

A: Although the regulation clearly states that "continuous residence in Spain for a minimum period of three years must be demonstrated," the Regulation of Organic Law 4/2000, approved by Royal Decree 557/2011, of April 20 (Articles 62 to 66 and 123 to 130), "allows" for a gap of up to 120 days. However, this criterion is quite debated and will depend on each individual case and the office where the application is processed.
