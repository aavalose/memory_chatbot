Q: Is it true that five years are now required for Arraigo Social?

A: No, that is not true. To apply for a Temporary Residence Permit under Exceptional Circumstances (Arraigo Social), continuous residence in Spain for three years must be demonstrated, not five years as some people claim. This requirement is established by the Regulation of Organic Law 4/2000, approved by Royal Decree 557/2011, of April 20 (Articles 62 to 66 and 123 to 130).
