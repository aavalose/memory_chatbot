Q: So I’m ready to submit my application for my residency as I’m married to a Spanish citizen.

The tarjeta comunitaria doesn’t need me to have a background check which I would need to go back to my home country to get. Could I do that rather than arraigo familiar? Or do I have to do arraigo familiar ?

A: I am pretty confident that, since your spouse is Spanish, you have to go through the arraigo familiar. From what I understand, on immigration-related issues, local laws supersede EU laws when they affect local citizens.
